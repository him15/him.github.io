			 <h3>Q1. What is the difference between an Inner Class and a Sub-Class?</h3>
                               
       <p>

Ans: An Inner class is a class which is nested within another class. An Inner class has access rights for the class which is nesting it and it can access all variables and methods defined in the outer class.

A sub-class is a class which inherits from another class called super class. Sub-class can access all public and protected methods and fields of its super class.</p>
             
			<h3>Q2. What are the various access specifiers for Java classes?</h3>
			<p>Ans: In Java, access specifiers are the keywords used before a class name which defines the access scope. The types of access specifiers for classes are:

1. Public : Class,Method,Field is accessible from anywhere.

2. Protected:Method,Field can be accessed from the same class to which they belong or from the sub-classes,and from the class of same package,but not from outside.

3. Default: Method,Field,class can be accessed only from the same package and not from outside of it's native package.

4. Private: Method,Field can be accessed from the same class to which they belong.</p><br><br>
			
			 
			<h3>Q3. What's the purpose of Static methods and static variables?</h3>
			<p>Ans: When there is a requirement to share a method or a variable between multiple objects of a class instead of creating separate copies for each object, we use static keyword to make a method or variable shared for all objects.</p><br><br>
			
			 
			<h3>Q4: What is an infinite Loop?</h3>
			<p>Ans: An infinite loop runs without any condition and runs infinitely. An infinite loop can be broken by defining any breaking logic in the body of the statement blocks.</p><br><br>
			
			 
			<h3>Q5. What is the difference between continue and break statement?</h3>
			<p>Ans: break and continue are two important keywords used in Loops. When a break keyword is used in a loop, loop is broken instantly while when continue keyword is used, current iteration is broken and loop continues with next iteration.</p><br><br>
			
			 
			<h3>Q6. What is the difference between double and float variables in Java?</h3>
			<p>Ans: In java, float takes 4 bytes in memory while Double takes 8 bytes in memory. Float is single precision floating point decimal number while Double is double precision decimal number.</p><br><br>
			
			 
			<h3>Q7: How can you generate random numbers in Java?</h3>
			<p>Ans:

Using Math.random() you can generate random numbers in the range greater than or equal to 0.1 and less than 1.0
Using Random class in package java.util</p><br><br>
			
			 
			<h3>Q8. What are Java Packages? What's the significance of packages?</h3>
			<p>Ans: In Java, package is a collection of classes and interfaces which are bundled together as they are related to each other. Use of packages helps developers to modularize the code and group the code for proper re-use. Once code has been packaged in Packages, it can be imported in other classes and used.</p><br><br>
			
			 
			<h3>Q9. Can we declare a class as Abstract without having any abstract method?</h3>
			<p>Ans: Yes we can create an abstract class by using abstract keyword before class name even if it doesn't have any abstract method. However, if a class has even one abstract method, it must be declared as abstract otherwise it will give an error.</p><br><br>
			
			 
			<h3>Q10. What's the difference between an Abstract Class and Interface in Java?</h3>
			<p>Ans: The primary difference between an abstract class and interface is that an interface can only possess declaration of public static methods with no concrete implementation while an abstract class can have members with any access specifiers (public, private etc) with or without concrete implementation.

Another key difference in the use of abstract classes and interfaces is that a class which implements an interface must implement all the methods of the interface while a class which inherits from an abstract class doesn't require implementation of all the methods of its super class.

A class can implement multiple interfaces but it can extend only one abstract class.</p><br><br>
			
			 
			<h3>Q11. Can we declare the main method of our class as private?</h3>
			<p>Ans: In java, main method must be public static in order to run any application correctly. If main method is declared as private, developer won't get any compilation error however, it will not get executed and will give a runtime error.</p><br><br>
			
			 
			<h3>Q12. How can we pass argument to a function by reference instead of pass by value?</h3>
			<p>Ans: In java, we can pass argument to a function only by value and not by reference.</p><br><br>
			
			 
			<h3>Q13. How an object is serialized in java?</h3>
			<p>Ans: In java, to convert an object into byte stream by serialization, an interface with the name Serializable is implemented by the class. All objects of a class implementing serializable interface get serialized and their state is saved in byte stream.</p><br><br>
			
			 
			<h3>Q14. When we should use serialization?</h3>
			<p>Ans: Serialization is used when data needs to be transmitted over the network. Using serialization, object's state is saved and converted into byte stream .The byte stream is transferred over the network and the object is re-created at destination.</p><br><br>
			
			 
			<h3>Q15. Is it compulsory for a Try Block to be followed by a Catch Block in Java for Exception handling?</h3>
			<p>Ans: Try block needs to be followed by either Catch block or Finally block or both. Any exception thrown from try block needs to be either caught in the catch block or else any specific tasks to be performed before code abortion are put in the Finally block.</p><br><br>
			
			 
			<h3>Q16. Is there any way to skip Finally block of exception even if some exception occurs in the exception block?</h3>
			<p>ns: If an exception is raised in Try block, control passes to catch block if it exists otherwise to finally block. Finally block is always executed when an exception occurs and the only way to avoid execution of any statements in Finally block is by aborting the code forcibly by writing following line of code at the end of try block:</p><br><br>
			
			 
			<h3>Q17. When the constructor of a class is invoked?</h3>
			<p>Ans: The constructor of a class is invoked every time an object is created with new keyword.

For example, in the following class two objects are created using new keyword and hence, constructor is invoked two times.</p><br><br>
			
			
			 
			<h3>Q18. Can a class have multiple constructors?</h3>
			<p>Ans: Yes, a class can have multiple constructors with different parameters. Which constructor gets used for object creation depends on the arguments passed while creating the objects.</p><br><br>
			
			
			 
			<h3>Q19. Can we override static methods of a class?</h3>
			<p>Ans: We cannot override static methods. Static methods belong to a class and not to individual objects and are resolved at the time of compilation (not at runtime).Even if we try to override static method,we will not get an complitaion error,nor the impact of overriding when running the code.</p><br><br>
			
			
			 
			<h3>Q20. Why Strings in Java are called as Immutable?</h3>
			<p>Ans: In java, string objects are called immutable as once value has been assigned to a string, it can't be changed and if changed, a new object is created.</p><br><br>
			
			<h3>Q21. Can we declare a class as Abstract without having any abstract method?</h3>
			<p>Ans: Yes we can create an abstract class by using abstract keyword before class name even if it doesn't have any abstract method. However, if a class has even one abstract method, it must be declared as abstract otherwise it will give an error.</p><br><br>
			
			 
			<h3>Q22. What's the difference between an Abstract Class and Interface in Java?</h3>
			<p>Ans: The primary difference between an abstract class and interface is that an interface can only possess declaration of public static methods with no concrete implementation while an abstract class can have members with any access specifiers (public, private etc) with or without concrete implementation.

Another key difference in the use of abstract classes and interfaces is that a class which implements an interface must implement all the methods of the interface while a class which inherits from an abstract class doesn't require implementation of all the methods of its super class.

A class can implement multiple interfaces but it can extend only one abstract class.</p><br><br>
			
			 
			<h3>Q23. Can we declare the main method of our class as private?</h3>
			<p>Ans: In java, main method must be public static in order to run any application correctly. If main method is declared as private, developer won't get any compilation error however, it will not get executed and will give a runtime error.</p><br><br>
			
			 
			<h3>Q24. How can we pass argument to a function by reference instead of pass by value?</h3>
			<p>Ans: In java, we can pass argument to a function only by value and not by reference.</p><br><br>
			 
			<h3>Q25. What is multi-threading?</h3>
			<p>Ans: Multi threading is a programming concept to run multiple tasks in a concurrent manner within a single program. Threads share same process stack and running in parallel. It helps in performance improvement of any program.</p><br><br>
			
			
			 
			<h3>Q26. Why Runnable Interface is used in Java?</h3>
			<p>Ans: Runnable interface is used in java for implementing multi threaded applications. Java.Lang.Runnable interface is implemented by a class to support multi threading.</p><br><br>
