			<h2>1.  Be an Intern in your college years</h2>
			<p>Do as many internships and projects as possible in your engineering years. This is the only way a recruiter will know that you have the ability to practically apply what you have learned theoretically.  95% of employers feel that candidate experience is a factor in hiring decisions, according to an annual survey by the National Association of Colleges and Employers (NACE). So, doing internships will surely place you a small step above others.<br>The humongous amount of experience you will get doing an internship will surely help you settle more easily into the workplace environment. You need experience to get experience and internships are a very good to way to get that experience and if you work diligently and with hard work, may be the company you are an intern at may delight you with a Pre-Placement Offer. <br><br><br></p>
			<br>
			
			
			
			 
			<h2>2.Start building your own Network</h2>
			<p>Start using LinkedIn, networking is much more important than you think. Networking not only helps you in climbing the career ladder, it also helps you to get your first firm and stronghold into the competitive modern world.<br>According to a joint research carried out by LinkedIn itself, they found that 85% of all jobs are filled via networking. That’s not a small number!<br><br><br><br><br></p><br><br>
			
			
			 
			<h2>3.    Improve your Problem-Solving Skills</h2>
			<p>Work on your problem-solving skills. That’s what recruiters look for the most in all their employees because they are interested in knowing how you will perform when you are put in completely new, unique and ambiguous conditions.<br>They don’t want an employee who needs to be guided at every small step. Rahter they need someone who can adapt, understand and execute.<br>Most technical jobs require you to be at a pro level in problem-solving skills.

There is a misconception among people that problem-solving skills cannot be developed and they are just certain gifted traits some people have. But this is not the case. With practice you can develop anything.

So, start exercising your brain with puzzles and riddles and improve these skills. Your brain is just like your muscles, you can exercise it to grow it. These skills will also help you in clearing the Aptitude tests most companies take before the main interview round.<br><br><br><br>  </p><br><br>
			
			
			 
				 
			<h2>4.   Improve your spoken English and Soft Skills</h2>
			<p>The recruiters look for employees who are confident and have no problem in conversing in English. So, poor English can take you straight out of the game. It’s better you start working on your English so that you have no problem in talking to the employer or anyone else.<br>You also need to work on your soft skills, otherwise you won’t be able to express yourself clearly.

A study conducted by A New Delhi-based employment solutions company, Aspiring Minds found that 73.63% lack basic English communication skills.<br><br><br><br></p><br><br>
			
			 
				 
			<h2>5.    Apply what you have learned</h2>
			<p>Rote learning doesn’t land you a job and neither does it help you in truly learning something.

Stop cramming and start questioning what you have learned, think about how you would apply it and where you would apply it. It’s only when you start questioning what is being taught to you that you start getting a real hang of things.<br>Get out of the old school habit of cramming everything you don’t understand, instead try and find out why aren’t you able to understand the topic, like – Is it because it is related to a topic you haven’t studied before or is it because of the way it is presented.

Until and unless you don’t question, you won’t get anything out of what you have learned. Look for online videos, editorials, research papers and study them or make teachers clear your doubts.<br><br>Educate yourself and don’t just train yourself, enrich your mind with knowledge and don’t overburden it with memorizing everything. For example: if you are a Computer Science student don’t just memorise all the algorithms, you try to understand them so that you can use the logic behind those algorithms elsewhere.<br><br><br><br></p><br><br>
			
			 
				 
			<h2>6.   Start Expanding Your Horizon</h2>
			<p>Start expanding your horizon by gaining real industry knowledge through rigorous and competitive online courses and training programs.<br>This is quite important as there is no dearth to BTech graduates or BTech colleges in India. So, in this densely populated and competitive sector, you have to find something that isn’t being done by everybody.<br>If you don’t, then you will be competing with an awful lot of people for a job that has very few seats.

So, be on the lookout for the advances in your field. For example in the case of Computer Science students, Data Science, Computer Generated Imagery, and Augmented Reality are some fields that are not much explored as of now. So you can try your hand at these by researching and by doing online courses on these topics.<br><br>You can also contribute to the open source world if you are a computer science graduate.

And if you are a chemical engineer, you can start studying and researching on the newly developed polymers .

Similarly, all the streams have their specific areas where extensive research is always being carried on, so you can start looking for these new areas and start studying about them.<br><br><br><br></p><br><br>
			 
				 
			<h2>7. Be a Jack of all Trades and Master of Some</h2>
			<p>A jack of all trades and master of none doesn’t work now, you have to be a jack of all trades and master of some. Try to gain mastery in at least one of the core subjects. By doing this, you will get your own originality among everyone.<br>You don’t win a league just by drawing all the matches, you have to win the important games too.

Just like that, you can be an average in all of the subjects but to balance that out you have to be at a supreme level in at least one of your subjects.<br>And the level of supremacy in those subjects should be outstanding. You shouldn’t have a problem in answering any question which the recruiter asks based on this topic. This subject is your weapon of mass destruction and only you should have the launch codes to it.

So, start looking for subjects you find to be easy or interesting and begin your conquest over it and don’t forget to do some interesting projects based on this topic too. This will show the recruiter that this is certainly your niche and craft.<br><br><br><br></p><br><br>


			<h2>8.   Go All In</h2>
			<p>Either go all in or don’t do it at all. Never settle for loose ends. Don’t go for the easy way, sometimes you have to embark on a tough journey just to live a more easy and comfortable life in the future.

<br> Whenever you feel like things are going beyond your control or you aren’t getting even a small knack of your studies, don’t quit. It may feel easy to quit right now but in the long run, you will surely regret this harsh decision because quitting to learn today will shatter down your hopes of becoming a big gun tomorrow<br>What do all the great entrepreneurs or the top businessmen have in common? It’s not their education or their talent, it’s their mindset of not quitting. They don’t quit no matter how dark the situation is. You have to be at your A game, you have to work and keep pushing until you succeed.<br><br><br><br></p><br><br>


			<h2>9.   Non-Core is Also an Option</h2>
			<p>The main aim is to be job worthy, so doing something that may harvest good results after some time isn’t harmful at all. Go on and use whatever time you have after classes or your commute time and start learning. And what you study can be completely different from what you are doing in your college.<br>There is a great demand for engineers in the field of data analytics primarily because of their analytical skills. You can also do a course on Treasury Management which is one of the most lucrative jobs right now.<br>So, if core subjects don’t work for you, then non-core is also an option.

So, look for the courses which interest you and do them. This will make you feel more empowered and you would also have gained a great amount of knowledge during the course.<br>Learning is a never-ending curve. All the great people around the world accept the fact that if you aren’t learning anything as you keep growing then you aren’t doing justice to yourself. Satya Nadella the CEO of Microsoft openly admits that he keeps on learning through online courses along being the head of Microsoft.<br><br><br><br></p><br><br>
